## [Considerations]:
1. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
2. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
3. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
4. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
5. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
6. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
7. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
8. We can adapt to the coming changes.
9. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
10. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
11. I care about the planet.
12. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
13. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
14. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
15. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
16. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
17. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
18. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
19. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
20. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
21. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
23. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
24. The fate of the planet is too important to be left to market forces.
25. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
26. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
27. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
28. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
29. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
30. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
31. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
32. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.

## [Considerations]:
1. It is already too late to do anything, as any action to stop climate change will take a long time to take effect.
2. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned and would like to do something, but I don't have a realistic shortlist of things that would really make a difference.
3. Climate variation is normal, so why should this be a problem?
4. When I read in the paper that climate change is not true, I start to have doubts about whether it is changing.
5. This is so depressing and is so out of our control.
6. I believe that the difference we can have as an individual, in Australia, is so minimal that our actions are worthless.
7. The response to  climate change is not going to be positive.  The same mistakes will keep happening.
8. It's difficult to trust what comes out in the media on the issue of climate change.
9. Australia's emissions are tiny, so it's not up to us to act.
10. We should pay for greenhouse emissions.
11. I think it is safe to say climate change is here.
12. We need strong political leadership to do something about climate change.
13. If Australia reduces greenhouse gases it won't make a difference. That will just shift Australian jobs to other countries. 
14. It is unfair that we are going to leave the climate in a mess for future generations.
15. Climate change will not be a problem because there will be technological solutions available.
16. I don't trust what I hear about climate change from government.
17. Governments should take a far greater role in preparing towns and cities to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
18. Doing something to reduce emissions feels a bit hopeless but I just want to feel that I'm doing the most I can.
19. We can adapt to the coming changes.
20. There's not much point in me doing anything to fix this. No-one else is going to.
21. Australia is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is in our interest to help find an effective global solution.
22. I'm not going to do anything to address climate change because it is not a major issue.
23. We need laws addressing climate change because people are not going to volunteer to change.
24. I don't trust what scientists say about climate change.
25. More educational programmes are needed to increase public awareness about climate change.
26. Australia does not owe it to the rest of the world to reduce emissions and suffer economically.
27. It is clear that we are already entering the zone of dangerous climate change.
28. I want to do something, but it is too big and too hard.
29. I'm not concerned enough to do anything drastic about this, such as participate in political action.
30. There is not enough information to definitively say that climate change is real.
31. Failure to address climate change is the fault of political leaders.
